# simple-footbal-game
A simple java text based football game which was I was asked during a SWE interview. The goal is to create a simple text base football game that provides a 
home team and an away team and determines the score and which team has won. 
There is a Team class, League class (which is a HashSet of teams), Match class and the main class.
